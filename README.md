# Pi-hole Personal Whitelist

This repository contains a **personal, hand-curated Pi-hole whitelist** compiled over many months. It is used in a production home setup with devices like Amazon Alexa, Synology, Smart Home gear (Tuya, Tasmota, ESPHome), streaming platforms (Netflix, Spotify), Home Assistant, and many developer tools.

>  **This whitelist is not generic** ‚Äì it is designed to solve specific connectivity issues with services in my environment. Use it as inspiration, but test carefully in your own setup.
